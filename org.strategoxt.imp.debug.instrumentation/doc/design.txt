Components:
SEL editor (spoofax project)
debug instrumentation (commandline utility)
generic debug runtime (java jar)
generic debugger (Eclipse plugin)

Artifacts:
dsldi.jar (contains code for the SEL editor, written in stratego)
dsldi-java.jar (external code, written in java)
libdsldi.jar (stratego code that performs the instrumentation)

Instrumentation order:

This is OK:
function-argument
function-argument
enter
try {
   ...
} finally {
   exit
}

This is OK:
function-argument
function-argument
try {
   enter
   ...
} finally {
   exit
}

The function argument event has to be before the enter event.
The enter/exit events are basically push-scope/pop-scope.
The function arguments are part of the push-scope

variable definition within a scope, the var is undefined when the scope is popped
variable assign, update the value
pop-scope, if the variable was defined in this scope, undefine the scope
