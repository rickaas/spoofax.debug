The libraries in this plugin are built from the projects:
 * org.strategoxt.imp.debug.instrumentation
 * org.spoofax.debug.interfaces
 * org.spoofax.debug.interfaces.java
This plugin is just are wrapper around these libraries
and provides some util methods to get the location of these jars
so they can be used on the classpath of a DSL program.
